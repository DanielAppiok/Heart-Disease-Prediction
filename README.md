# Heart-Disease-Prediction

### Overview
This project is focused on building a predictive machine learning model to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various medical attributes. The project applies a professional data science pipeline and emphasizes clean, explainable, and reproducible work.

 Objectives
Develop a robust classification model to predict the presence of heart disease.

Identify key risk factors contributing to heart disease using feature importance.

Compare multiple machine learning models and tune them for optimal performance.

Deploy a trained model that can generalize well on unseen patient data.

Emphasize prevention of data leakage throughout the workflow.
